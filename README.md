# Acosta Magazine

A 5.56 (.223) magazine for rifles in Eugene's famous pattern (STANAG)

Most of the mags people design in FOSSCAD are named after opposition politicians or in a simple descriptive manner. I chose to name this one after Mr. Acosta in honor of his choice to publicly air the dirty laundry of the corrupt power structure/deep state/zersetzung.

The design goals of this magazine are:

 - minimal assembly steps/hardware
 - fits into and slides out of a standard magazine well without modification
 - fires reliably
 - reasonably durable

This is meant for recreational shooting and training. Do not base your self defense or community defense plans on this magazine unless you truly have no other option.
